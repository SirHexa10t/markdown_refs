## Beginner-instructions for running the Python files in Linux

You can run the Python scripts on Linux through your terminal (by just calling the filename by full path or locally: ./<pyscript-name.py>),
make sure that they point to your python installation correctly;

To do so, run:
```which python3```

Then make sure that the printed response corresponds to the first line of your python-file 

### Example
By default the path in these repositories is: `#!/usr/bin/python3` or `#! /usr/bin/python3`.

This means that you'll attempt to run the script in this file using: `/usr/bin/python3`
