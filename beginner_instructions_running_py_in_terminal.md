## Beginner-instructions for running the Python files in Linux

You can run the Python scripts on Linux through your terminal, by just calling the filename (full-path) or locally: `./<pyscript-name.py>`.

To do so, run: ```which python3```.
Then make sure that the printed response corresponds to the first line of your python-file 

### Example
By default the first line in these repositories's files is: `#!/usr/bin/python3` or `#! /usr/bin/python3`.

This means that you'll attempt to run the script in this file using: `/usr/bin/python3`
